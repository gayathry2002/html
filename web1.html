    <p style="position: absolute;padding-left: 200px;">Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light,<br> either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film.<br> It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.[1]

<p> Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing<br>. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image,<br> either negative or positive, depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>
